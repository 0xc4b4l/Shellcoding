# Reversing and analyzing shellcode
In this repo I will be reversing and trying to understand how random shellcode payloads work at a low level. Using msfvenom, shellstorm to find fun chunks of shellcode to analyze. This will help me learn more ASM and also learn some new shellcoding skills.

1. Case study 1 - calling setuid(0) and spawning /bin/sh
2. Case study 2 - Reads /etc/passwd
